## General Information

This webapp creates a simple to do list that allows users to create, organize tasks based on priority of the task. Tasks can be also be stored in new folders, and organized according to the criteria defined by the user. All tasks will have a due date to act as a reminder. These folders and tasks will be stored in the local storage of the browser so that the user can easily reaccess the to do list by just visiting the web address.

## Usage
